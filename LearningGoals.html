            Why am I at the University of Portsmouth?
            <br>
            When looking at what university I wanted to study at I looked through each course specification and what the course consited of. THe biggest reason for choosing the University of Portsmouth was that the course had a lot more progrtamming and web development units compared to other universitys.
